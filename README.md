# Horadric

[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Mopra/horadric.dev/total?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/Mopra/horadric.dev/releases/latest)

Every coding agent session you have running becomes a small tile on your
Windows desktop, grouped by project, that lights up when it needs you and
grows into a full terminal when you click it. Sessions share one working
tree and commit on it, or, if you pick that work mode for a project, each
works in a git worktree of its own and the tile shows you what it changed.
When two sessions in one tree edit the same file, both you and the agent
hear about it.

Horadric is a window manager for agent sessions that already exist. It never
puts its own chat UI in front of the agent. The terminal is the UI.

Status: early. The tiles, the state stream behind them and the terminals
work. Worktrees are next.

## What works now

- `horadric` opens one cluster window per project on the left edge of your
  screen: frameless, rounded, never takes focus, not in the taskbar or
  alt-tab. It stacks like a normal window: other windows can cover it, a
  click brings it forward, and "Bring tiles to front" in the tray menu
  brings them all back. The clusters stand in columns as tall as the
  screen, and the files tiles in a column share the room the tiles leave.
  Drag a cluster to another place, another column or a new one at the
  right. A new project never moves the others, and another screen lays the
  same columns out again. The wheel scrolls a column that holds more than
  fits. Click the header to collapse a cluster.
- Each tile shows a session: an icon for its state, name, an age line like
  "needs permission 12 min", and the last line worth reading. Waiting tiles
  light up amber.
- A project in git gets a files tile at the bottom of its cluster: the file
  tree as VS Code's explorer shows it, changed files coloured with their
  letter (M, A, U, D), folders marked when something inside changed. It
  updates as files change, without polling. Click a folder to open it, a
  file to open it in VS Code, the header to fold it.
- A tray icon starts sessions: "New session..." asks for a folder, and your
  recent projects are one click away. It also quits Horadric.
- `horadric explorer install` adds "Open in Horadric" to folders in Explorer,
  which starts Horadric too if it is not running.
- A session runs `claude` in a Horadric terminal: a real terminal with the
  real CLI in it, permissions, slash commands and all. The sessions share one
  terminal window, the stage, which shows one project at a time: every
  session of that project is a pane in a grid. One fills the window, two
  sit side by side, four are two by two. Click a tile and the stage switches
  to its project with that session typing; click it again or close the
  window to collapse it. Other projects keep running unseen, and the tiles
  on stage are lit. The `+` in a cluster header starts another, and
  `horadric new --name fix-login` does it from a script.
- Drag a pane by its header onto another to swap the two. The order is
  remembered. "Fit terminal beside tiles" in the tray menu fills the space
  right of the clusters. The terminal snaps to the screen edges and the
  tiles, when moved and when an edge is dragged to resize, and Shift
  places it freely.
- Plain terminals for everything that is not the agent: a dev server, a
  log, a deploy. The small button beside a cluster's bottom `+`, Ctrl+Shift+T
  in any pane, or "New terminal" in the project menu opens PowerShell in the
  project, as a pane on the stage and a tile in the cluster. The tile shows
  what the terminal's title says and how busy its output is. `exit` closes
  it. `HORADRIC_SHELL` picks another shell.
- Zoom a pane with the button at the end of its header, a double click on
  the header, or Ctrl+Shift+Enter: it fills the stage alone until you zoom
  out. Ctrl+Alt and an arrow moves the keyboard to the pane beside it. Ctrl
  and plus, minus or the wheel sizes the font, Ctrl+0 puts it back.
- Ctrl+Shift+F searches a pane's history, which keeps 10,000 lines. Enter
  finds the next match up, Shift+Enter the next one down, Esc closes it.
- A browser pane: Ctrl+Shift+B in any pane, or "Browser" in the project
  menu, puts a web page on the stage beside the sessions and asks where
  to go (`localhost:3000`, an address, or words to search). Ctrl+L asks
  again, a right click on its header has back, forward and reload. Every
  project and every session share one browser profile, so a login stays.
  The page keeps its place when the stage shows another project.
- Ctrl+click opens what a pane shows: a web address in the browser pane
  when the project has one, otherwise in your browser, a
  file in VS Code at its line (`src/main.rs:12`, relative to the session's
  folder), a folder in Explorer, a program by running it. Hold Ctrl and
  the link under the mouse is underlined.
- A quest log per project: `.horadric/quests.md` (a `tasks.md` from
  before the rename is still read), a Markdown checklist in the repo,
  shown in a quests tile in the cluster. Click a quest and a session
  starts on it, with the quest as its prompt; the agent reports back with
  `horadric quest done` or `horadric quest blocked "why"`, and the row
  shows where it is. The mode button picks how the list is worked: Manual,
  one click per item; Review, the next item starts once you approve the
  last; Warriv reviews, as Review but a reviewer session reads each
  finished quest and its diff first, then lands it with `horadric quest
  pass "title"`, sends it back with `horadric quest fix "title" "what"`
  or hands it to you; Auto, down the list until it is done. The `+` adds an item, and so
  does `horadric quest add` from any shell. A quest blocked with
  `--on-quest "title"`, `--on-main ref`, `--on-file path`, `--on-cmd
  "command"` or `--until +30m` goes on by itself once that holds, and the
  list works on past it meanwhile.
- Warriv, an orchestrator per project, off unless `"orchestrator": true`
  is in `.horadric/config.json`. When a quest blocks on a question, a
  session stops without reporting, an `After:` line names nothing, a
  merge fails or the log in auto mode has nothing left to start, a fresh
  Warriv session wakes with what happened. It answers the quest's session
  with `horadric quest tell "title" "message"`, adds or splits quests,
  writes what it decided as a `Warriv:` note under the quest, and hands
  the rest to you with `horadric quest blocked "question" --quest
  "title"`. It changes no code, starts no session, and wakes at most six
  times an hour per project.
- A Runetome per project: rune stones under the quest log, each a button
  that casts a runeword, a list of steps done in order. A step says
  something to the session and waits for its turn to end, types keys into
  its terminal (`"/clear{Enter}"`, `"Esc"`), runs a command in the
  project's folder (hidden, or in a pane to watch), or tests, reviews or
  merges. Click a stone to cast it on the session with the keyboard on the
  stage, or pick a session; drag it onto any tile or pane to cast it
  there. A stone of only commands needs no session. Hover one to read its
  steps first. A click asks before it casts, showing every step, until you
  tick "Do not ask again". While it runs it glows with its step, and a
  click stops it. Built in stones answer a prompt (Approve), stop a turn
  (Interrupt), ask for a recap, commit, start fresh, get a second opinion
  from a reviewer and open the folder. The empty stone starts the
  Runesmith, an agent that asks what the new stone should do and writes it
  into `.horadric/config.json`, or into `runewords.json` beside Horadric's
  state for every project. Right click a stone to remove it, have the
  Runesmith change it, or put a built in one away. A stone that came with
  the project and changed since you last cast it carries a dot, and asks
  before it casts even when you said not to.
- Right click a tile to rename its session, or a project's header to open
  its folder in VS Code or Explorer.
- Ctrl+Alt+Space, from anywhere, shows the session that has waited on you
  longest. Press it again to move on to the next one. Settings, under Keys,
  sets this and the other two shortcuts to keys of your own: click one and
  press them. When a session starts
  waiting and you are not looking at it, Windows shows a notification; a
  click on it shows the session. Settings can switch that off.
- "Settings..." in the tray menu opens one window with every setting, in
  sections: Appearance, Notifications, Sessions, Keys, Startup and
  updates, Privacy, Runetome and Projects. A change takes effect the
  moment you make it, so there is no Save.
- "Show on Discord" in Settings, under Privacy, puts what your agents do on your
  Discord profile, "Playing Horadric: 2 agents working, 1 waits for you",
  with a clock that counts the whole run of work, not each turn. It is
  off until you choose it, and "Without project names" keeps the project
  off a profile your friends and servers can see; "With project names"
  adds the one on the stage, or the busiest. Quit, reload and Off clear
  it. It talks to the Discord desktop app through its local pipe, so
  nothing happens while Discord is closed.
- A Claude window at the top of the stack shows how much of your five hour,
  weekly and spend limits is used and when each resets, and picks the
  model, effort and permission mode for every session Horadric starts or
  resumes. Each tile shows how full its session's context is. The numbers
  come from Claude Code's status line, which Horadric sets for its own
  sessions only.
- With more than one Claude subscription, the Account row in that window
  switches between them. Add account opens `claude auth login` once per
  account. A switch waits for each session to finish its turn, then
  resumes them all on the new account, conversations and all.
- `horadric hooks install` adds Claude Code hooks to `~/.claude/settings.json`.
  They are `http` hooks: Claude Code posts each lifecycle event to Horadric on
  localhost. No script runs, no process is spawned per event.
- `horadric run --name fix-login` starts a tagged `claude` in the terminal you
  are in instead. Its tile shows state but can not expand. A `claude`
  started any other way is ignored.
- `horadric serve` shows the same state as a table in the terminal.

The whole app is one process. With two projects and four sessions on screen
it uses about 45 MB and no CPU between events. The terminals are ConPTY,
`alacritty_terminal` for the grid, and our own DirectWrite glyph renderer.

## How it knows

Horadric sets `HORADRIC_SESSION` in the environment of every `claude` it starts.
The hook is configured to send that variable as a header, so every event
arrives already tagged with the tile it belongs to. Outside Horadric the header
is empty and the event is dropped.

State comes from hook events, never from reading terminal output:

| Event | State |
|---|---|
| `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse` | working |
| `PermissionRequest`, `Notification` (permission, idle, dialog) | waiting |
| `StopFailure` | waiting, with the error |
| `Stop` | done |
| `SessionEnd` | ended |

Subagent events and compaction restarts do not change state.

## Build

Rust stable on Windows.

```
cargo build --release
target\release\horadric.exe install
```

That installs Horadric for your user, no admin rights: it is in the Start
menu (search "Horadric"), `horadric` works in any new terminal, "Open in Horadric"
is on folders in Explorer (under "Show more options" on Windows 11), it
starts with Windows, and the Claude Code hooks are in place. Horadric lives in
the tray; Windows may hide a new icon behind the `^` by the clock.

Each session's console runs in a small host process of its own, so the
agents keep running when Horadric crashes, reloads, or quits with "keep
running": the next start finds them where they were, screen and all.
Sessions whose process is gone (a restart of Windows, or Quit with "stop
them") come back as paused tiles, and a click resumes the conversation.

`HORADRIC_AGENT=cmd.exe` runs a shell instead of `claude` in the terminals,
which is the cheap way to try them.

`HORADRIC_DEV=1` runs a build beside the installed Horadric without touching
it: its own port and saved state, no autostart, a red lit tray icon. That is how
Horadric is developed from a session inside Horadric.

`target\release\horadric.exe reload` updates a running Horadric to a new build
without the quit. It hands over at once and the new build attaches to the
running sessions, mid turn or not. A build that fails to start is rolled
back.

`horadric uninstall` takes it all back out. The hooks it removes are only
Horadric's; everything else in your Claude Code settings stays as it was.

## Plan

1. Hook receiver and state machine. Done.
2. Cluster windows on Win32 and Direct2D. Done.
3. Terminal window: ConPTY, the alacritty grid, our own glyph renderer. Done.
4. Worktree per session, changed files, open in VS Code.
5. Inbox, installer, updater.

Pure Rust, Win32 and Direct2D directly. No toolkit, and no web view
except the browser pane, which shows web pages.
[docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) has the detail, the open questions and the
known gaps.

## Not doing

- A chat UI of its own.
- Progress bars or time estimates.
- An embedded editor or diff viewer. VS Code does that.
- Merging worktrees back. Git and the human do that.
- Mac or Linux, for now.
