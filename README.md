## What is Horadric?

Running five agent sessions at once means five terminals piled on top of
each other, and the one that has been waiting for your permission for
twenty minutes is always at the bottom.

Horadric fixes that. Each session becomes a small tile on the edge of your
screen, grouped by project, showing what it is doing and how long it has
been doing it. A tile lights up amber the moment its agent needs you. Click
it and the session opens in a real terminal, with the real CLI in it.

It works with **Claude Code**, **Codex** and **Grok Build**. It never puts a
chat UI of its own in front of the agent. The terminal is the UI.

## Features

**Tiles**

- One small, frameless cluster window per project. Never steals focus,
  never in the taskbar or alt tab.
- Each tile shows the session's state, name, an age line like "needs
  permission 12 min", the last line worth reading and how full its context
  is.
- A files tile shows the project's tree with changed files marked, like VS
  Code's explorer. Click a file to open it in VS Code.
- Drag clusters into columns, collapse them, scroll a long column.

**The stage**

- One terminal window for every session. It shows one project at a time,
  each session a pane in a grid. Click a tile to switch projects.
- Zoom a pane, swap panes by dragging, search 10,000 lines of history.
- Plain terminals beside the agents, for a dev server, a log or a deploy.
- A browser pane for `localhost:3000` or anything else, that your agents
  can drive too.
- Ctrl+click a path in a pane to open the file in VS Code at that line.

**Getting your attention**

- **Ctrl+Alt+Space**, from anywhere, jumps to the session that has waited
  longest. Press it again for the next one.
- A Windows notification when a session starts waiting and you are not
  looking at it.

**Working through a list**

- A quest log per project, a plain Markdown checklist in the repo. Click a
  quest and a session starts on it. Run the list by hand, with your review
  between items, or all the way down.
- Warriv, an optional orchestrator that wakes when a quest gets stuck and
  answers it, splits it, or hands it to you.
- The Runetome: buttons that run a list of steps on a session. Approve,
  interrupt, commit, ask for a review, or anything you describe to the
  Runesmith, which writes the button for you.

**Accounts and limits**

- See how much of your five hour, weekly and spend limits is used, and pick
  the model, effort and permission mode for new sessions.
- Switch between Claude subscriptions. Every session resumes on the new
  account, conversations and all.

**Built to stay out of the way**

- Pure Rust, drawing straight to Win32 and Direct2D. About 45 MB with four
  sessions open, and no CPU between events.
- Sessions survive a crash, a restart of Horadric or an update. Click a
  paused tile after a reboot and the conversation resumes.
- Updates itself, with every build signed.
- Optional Discord status: "Playing Horadric: 2 agents working, 1 waits for
  you".

## Install

You need Windows 10 or 11 and at least one of
[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code),
[Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) or Grok Build.

1. Download `horadric.exe` and `horadricw.exe` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/Mopra/horadric.dev/releases/latest)
   into the same folder.
2. Open a terminal in that folder and run:

   ```
   .\horadric.exe install
   ```

That is all. No admin rights needed. Horadric now:

- is in the Start menu (search "Horadric") and starts with Windows,
- answers to `horadric` in any new terminal,
- adds "Open in Horadric" to folders in Explorer (under "Show more options"
  on Windows 11),
- has the hooks it needs in your agent's settings.

It lives in the tray. Windows may hide a new tray icon behind the `^` by the
clock.

The downloaded files are not yet code signed, so Windows SmartScreen may
warn you the first time. Choose "More info", then "Run anyway". Updates
after that are checked against Horadric's own signature.

## Getting started

1. Click the tray icon and pick **New session...**, or right click a project
   folder in Explorer and choose **Open in Horadric**.
2. A tile appears and the stage opens with your agent in it. Work as you
   always do.
3. Start more sessions with the `+` on the project's header. Click away. When
   one needs you, its tile turns amber.

Everything else is in **Settings...** in the tray menu.

### Keys

| Key | Does |
|---|---|
| Ctrl+Alt+Space | Show the session that has waited longest (global) |
| Ctrl+Shift+T | New plain terminal in this project |
| Ctrl+Shift+B | Browser pane |
| Ctrl+Shift+Enter | Zoom the pane in or out |
| Ctrl+Alt+Arrow | Move to the pane beside |
| Ctrl+Shift+F | Search the pane's history |
| Ctrl+Plus, Ctrl+Minus, Ctrl+0 | Font size |
| Ctrl+click | Open the link, file or folder under the mouse |

The global shortcuts can be changed in Settings, under Keys.

### From the command line

```
horadric new --name fix-login          start a session in this folder
horadric new --agent codex             start one with another agent
horadric quest add "Fix the login bug" add to the quest log
horadric serve                         every session's state as a table
```

`horadric help` lists the rest.

## How it knows

Horadric reads state from your agent's own lifecycle hooks, never from the
text in the terminal. Claude Code posts each event to Horadric over
localhost: a prompt submitted means working, a permission request means
waiting, a stop means done. Only sessions Horadric started are tracked;
anything else is ignored.

## Privacy

No telemetry, no analytics, no crash reporting. The only thing that leaves
your machine is the daily update check against GitHub, and Discord status
if you switch it on. [docs/PRIVACY.md](docs/PRIVACY.md) has the full audit.

## Uninstall

```
horadric uninstall
```

This removes Horadric from PATH, the Start menu, Explorer and startup, and
takes out only its own hooks. Your agent settings stay as they were. Saved
sessions stay in `%APPDATA%\Horadric`.

## Build from source

Rust stable on Windows (the exact version is pinned in
`rust-toolchain.toml`).

```
cargo build --release
target\release\horadric.exe install
```

`HORADRIC_AGENT=cmd.exe` runs a shell instead of an agent in the terminals,
the cheap way to try them. `HORADRIC_DEV=1` runs a build beside the
installed one with its own port and state, which is how Horadric is
developed from inside Horadric. `horadric reload` swaps a running Horadric
over to a new build without stopping a single session.

[docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) has the design, the decisions behind it and the
known gaps.

## Not doing

- A chat UI of its own.
- Progress bars or time estimates.
- An embedded editor or diff viewer. VS Code does that.
- Mac or Linux, for now.
