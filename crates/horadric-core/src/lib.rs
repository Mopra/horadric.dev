//! Core model for Horadric: what a session is, what state it is in, and how
//! Claude Code hook events move it between states.
//!
//! This crate has no I/O. The hook listener feeds it [`HookEvent`]s, the UI
//! reads [`Session`]s out of a [`Registry`]. Everything here is testable
//! without a terminal or a network.
