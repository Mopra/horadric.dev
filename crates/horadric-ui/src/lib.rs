//! The desktop face of Horadric.
//!
//! One frameless window per project cluster. Tiles are drawn
//! inside it with Direct2D and DirectWrite. There is no toolkit and no web
//! view: the window manager fight is the whole project, so nothing sits
//! between us and Win32.
//!
//! An expanded session is a second kind of window, a real terminal: the
//! agent runs in a ConPTY, `alacritty_terminal` keeps the grid, and the grid
//! is drawn with DirectWrite glyph runs. The sessions share one terminal,
//! the stage, which shows one project at a time with each of its sessions
//! as a pane in a grid. A click on a tile switches it to that project.
//!
//! One more window belongs to no project: the usage window, with the
//! account's Claude limits and the settings for sessions ([`usage`]), whose
//! lists drop down in a window of their own (`dropdown`).
//! Another stands in for the first project while none is open, so an empty
//! desktop says how to begin (`start`).
//!
//! A file clicked in a files tile is shown on the stage too, read only, as a
//! pane with no program behind it ([`viewer`], [`highlight`]).
//!
//! A project can also have plain terminals, a shell with no agent, for
//! whatever else the work needs. They are sessions with a tile and a pane
//! like the rest ([`shell`]).
//!
//! Each project has a task list, `.horadric/tasks.md`, shown in a tasks
//! tile in its cluster. A click on an item starts a session on it, and the
//! app can work down the list by itself ([`board`], `horadric_core::tasks`).
//!
//! [`anim`], [`board`], [`columns`], [`files`], [`find`], [`layout`], [`theme`], [`palette`], [`paste`],
//! [`keys`], [`frame`], [`icon`], [`inbox`], [`motion`], [`viewer`],
//! [`highlight`], [`history`] and [`shell`] are pure and tested, and so is
//! the list logic in `recent`.
//! The rest is Windows only and verified on screen.
