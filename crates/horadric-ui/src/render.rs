//! Direct2D and DirectWrite drawing for a cluster window and the usage
//! window.
//!
//! [`Gpu`] holds the process wide factories and text formats. [`Target`] is
//! one window's render target and brushes. Drawing happens in DIPs; Direct2D
//! applies the DPI.
//!
//! A cluster is a faceplate on a piece of hardware: matte metal lit from
//! above, sessions as keys standing up off it, each with a lamp, and a
//! screen sunk into it for the files. Direct2D's hwnd targets have no blur,
//! so every soft shadow is a stack of shapes each a little bigger and
//! fainter (`Painter::cast`, `Painter::hollow`). A session's lamp says what
//! it does: a working one has light running up and down it, a waiting one
//! breathes and backlights its whole key, an ended one is dark and its key
//! latched down.
