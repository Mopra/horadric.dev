//! The UI thread: owns the cluster windows and the terminal windows, the
//! consoles behind them, and keeps the set of windows in sync with the set
//! of sessions.
//!
//! Sessions share one terminal window, the stage, which shows one project
//! at a time: each of its sessions is a pane in a grid. A click on a tile
//! switches the stage to that tile's project and gives its session the
//! keyboard; the sessions of other projects keep running unseen. A global
//! hotkey brings up the session that has waited on you longest.
//!
//! Everything that happens off the UI thread arrives as a message to one
//! hidden window: hook events from the feeder thread, new session requests
//! from the listener, output and exit from the consoles, clicks queued by the
//! window procedures, and the tray icon. A window, not the thread, because
//! thread messages are dropped while Windows runs a modal loop, and resizing
//! a terminal by its edge is a modal loop. A hidden top level window rather
//! than a message-only one, because only top level windows hear Explorer's
//! `TaskbarCreated` broadcast and the shutdown messages. A one second timer
//! on the same window moves the age lines and saves the state.
//!
//! A browser window a session opens is placed beside the stage when it
//! first appears, and follows its project: switching the stage to another
//! project minimises the browsers of the rest and brings back that one's.
//!
//! Every console runs in a session host of its own, so the sessions outlive
//! the app: a start finds the hosts still running and attaches to them,
//! with their screens replayed. What Horadric owned is saved to disk as it
//! changes too. A session whose host is gone comes back as a paused tile,
//! and clicking one resumes its conversation with `claude --resume`.
//!
//! `horadric reload` hands the app over to a new build at once: this one
//! saves, starts the new build's `swap`, and quits. The new app attaches to
//! the same hosts, so an update costs a few seconds and no session notices.
