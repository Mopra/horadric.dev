//! The app's side of the task list: reading each project's list when it
//! changes, starting a session on an item, and the runner that works down
//! a list by itself in review and auto mode.
//!
//! The file is the state. Taking an item writes its session beside it
//! before the session starts, so a list read a moment later already says
//! the item is taken, and the runner can never start it twice. The runner
//! holds one item per project at a time, or with `"parallel"` in the
//! config several, each in a worktree of its own while the list stays in
//! the main tree. It starts at most one session per project every few
//! seconds, and never resumes a paused one by itself:
//! a runner that starts agents is the one piece of Horadric that could run
//! away, and each of those rules is a fuse against it.
//!
//! What the runner does on each look, per project:
//! - a session whose item is done, and that is not mid turn, closes;
//! - a session whose turn ended without a report is asked, once, whether
//!   it is finished;
//! - review, blocked and unanswered items are announced once each;
//! - with nothing in hand, the next open item starts;
//! - while a usage limit is used up nothing starts, and a session the
//!   limit stopped is told to go on once it has reset;
//! - while one is 90 % used nothing starts either, so the sessions
//!   running have what is left to finish their turns.
