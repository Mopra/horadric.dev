//! One session inside the stage: a child window that draws its console's
//! grid and takes its keyboard and mouse.
//!
//! The stage lays its panes out in a grid, one per session of the project
//! it shows. Each pane has a header naming its session, with buttons to
//! stash, zoom and end it, and dragging a header onto another pane swaps
//! the two. The drag itself is
//! the stage's: a pane only says it was grabbed.
//!
//! A pane can also show a file instead of a session (see
//! [`Console::view`]). It is read only: keys scroll it, Ctrl+C copies, and
//! Esc or the cross in its header closes it.
//!
//! Ctrl+Shift+T in any pane opens a plain terminal in the project on the
//! stage. A few more chords belong to the stage, not the program
//! ([`keys::chord`]): zoom, moving to the next pane, the font size, and
//! Ctrl+Shift+F, which opens a search bar over the pane. While it is open
//! the keyboard types into it: Enter finds the next match up the history,
//! Shift+Enter the next one down, Esc closes it.
