//! The stage: the one terminal window, showing every session of one
//! project at a time.
//!
//! Each session is a [`Pane`] inside it, laid out in a grid: one fills the
//! window, two sit side by side, four are two by two. A click on a tile
//! switches the stage to that tile's project and gives its session the
//! keyboard. With more than one pane, dragging a pane's header onto another
//! swaps the two.
//!
//! Zoomed, the pane with the keyboard fills the stage alone and the rest
//! wait hidden, keeping their size. Moving the keyboard to another pane
//! (Ctrl+Alt+arrow, or a tile) zooms that one instead, so zoom reads as
//! looking at one pane at a time. Switching project ends it.
//!
//! Unlike a cluster, this window takes focus, because you type into it. It
//! is a normal window: resizable, in the taskbar and in alt-tab. Closing it
//! only collapses the sessions back into their tiles; the agents keep
//! running.
