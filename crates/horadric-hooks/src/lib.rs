//! How Claude Code tells Horadric what a session is doing.
//!
//! Claude Code supports `http` hooks: on every lifecycle event it POSTs the
//! event payload to a URL. Horadric listens on localhost for those posts. The
//! hook is configured to send the `HORADRIC_SESSION` environment variable as a
//! header, so a `claude` started by Horadric (or inside a Horadric terminal) is
//! tagged with the tile it belongs to, and a `claude` started anywhere else
//! sends an empty header and is ignored.
//!
//! No script runs, no process is spawned per event. Connection refused when
//! Horadric is not running costs Claude Code a few microseconds.
